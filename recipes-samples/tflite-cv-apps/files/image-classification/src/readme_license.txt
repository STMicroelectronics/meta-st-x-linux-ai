Question:
========
The image classification application example is delivered to me under ST Ultimate
Liberty (SLA0044) license that is basically an ST proprietary license. However,
several files delivered in this component have an Apache 2.0 license header most
often with an TensorFlow Authors copyright declaration. Why? What license terms
do actually apply for those files and more generally for image classification
application example?

Answer:
======
Apache 2.0 license authorizes that “Derivative Works as a whole” using Apache 2.0
code to be delivered with another license provided compatibility is respected.
This is the case as we deliver image classification application example to you
under SLA0044 license.
Particularly, Apache 2.0 license requires that:
1.	We give to you a copy of this License: this is available in the
	APACHE-2.0.txt file at the root of image classification application example; and
2.	We cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that we
	changed the files: these are the files modified by us with the addition
	of STMicroelectronics copyright to the original TensorFlow Authors
	copyright; and
3.	We retain, in the Source form that we distribute, all copyright and
	attribution notices from the original Source form of the Work: this is the
	reason why TensorFlow Authors original copyright declarations and license heading
	have been retained; and
4.	Any Derivative Works that we distribute must include a readable copy of
	the attribution notices contained within original work, in at least one of
	three possible places (within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
	Derivative Works, within the Source form or documentation or within a
	display generated by the Derivative Works): we deliver to you the readable
	copy of the attribution notices within the Source form.

As a conclusion, we confirm that image classification application example is
licensed under SLA0044 license terms and that they use parts of TensorFlow Author
copyrighted components originally licensed under Apache 2.0 license. Respecting
the original Apache 2.0 license terms obliges us to retain TensorFlow Author
copyright declarations as well as Apache 2.0 file headers.
