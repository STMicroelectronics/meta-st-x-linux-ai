# These models are not available in the onnx/models repository and integrating the tf2onnx
# converter in the yocto workflow (to convert them from tflite) would require integrating
# tensorflow (not lite) and bazel as well, which is a pretty big undertaking.
# So, for now, we will simply include the converted models manually.
