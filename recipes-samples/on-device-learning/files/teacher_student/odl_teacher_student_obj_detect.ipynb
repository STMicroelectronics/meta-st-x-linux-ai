    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "### 1. Teacher-Student Machine Learning:\n",
    "Teacher-student machine learning with automatic labeling is an advanced technique where a large, well-trained model (the teacher) is used to generate labels for a dataset that lacks annotations. The teacher model predicts labels for the unlabeled data, which are then used to train a smaller, simpler model (the student). This process allows the student model to learn from the teacher's knowledge, effectively transferring the teacher's expertise to the student. This method is particularly useful for creating efficient models for deployment on resource-constrained devices, while also reducing the need for manual data labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Transfer Learning:\n",
    "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model, developed for one task, is adapted to perform a different but related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, transfer learning leverages the knowledge gained from the initial task to improve the performance and efficiency of the new task. This approach is particularly useful when there is limited data available for the new task, as it allows the model to benefit from the extensive training of the pre-trained model. This tutorial showcases the transfer learning technique where knowledge gained from training a model on one task is leveraged to improve the performance of a model on a different but related task. Instead of starting the learning process from scratch, transfer learning allows us to transfer the knowledge or features learned by a pre-trained model to a new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Introduction of the use case:\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the concept of transfer learning using an example dataset and evaluate the ORT training API on an **STM32MP257** device. We will employ a custom dataset where data is directly **retrieved**, **processed**, and **labeled** for training directly on the device. For this tutorial, we will leverage the SSD MobileNetV2 model which has been trained on large-scale image datasets such as PASCAL VOC for object detection (which has 20 classes). We will use this model for detecting custom data into one class. The class for this use case will be person but the user is free to adapt the use case into his needs. The initial layers of SSD MobileNetV2 serve as a feature extractor, capturing generic visual features applicable to various tasks, and only the final layer will be trained for the task at hand. The figure below summarizes the whole workflow followed to realize this Teacher Student Machine Learning workflow:\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Prerequisites:\n",
    "In order to be able to retrain the model using Onnxruntime training API, it is mandatory to generate the training artifacts:\n",
    "*  `Training model (onnx.ModelProto)`: Contains the base model graph, loss subgraph and the gradient graph.\n",
    "*  `Eval Model (onnx.ModelProto)`: Contains the base model graph and the loss subgraph.\n",
    "*  `Optimizer Model (onnx.ModelProto)`: Contains the optimizer graph.\n",
    "*  `Checkpoint (Directory)`: Contains the model parameters split into 2 .pbsec files, one for frozen parameters and one for trainable parameters.\n",
    "These artifacts can be generated by running the following [the dedicated wiki article](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_generate_training_artifacts_for_on-device_learning_feature#) on your host computer. These artifacts should be then deployed on the **STM32MP257** board using either the `scp` tool or the drag and drop functionality provided by this Jupyter-lab.\n"

This approach eliminates the need to transfer sensitive data to external servers for processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. It allows for personalized models that can adapt to individual user behavior and preferences without compromising data security. Therefore the need to use on-device camera sensor. "

    "## III. Preparing dataset in PASCAL VOC format with automatic labeling using Teacher Model\n",
    "Real-Time Detection Transformer **(RT-DETR)**, developed by Baidu, is a cutting-edge end-to-end object detector that provides real-time performance while maintaining high accuracy. It is based on the idea of DETR (the NMS-free framework), meanwhile introducing conv-based backbone and an efficient hybrid encoder to gain real-time speed. For this use case, **RT-DETR**  is used as a teacher model because of its high accuracy in automatic labeling by leveraging its robust detection capabilities to generate precise annotations for unlabeled datasets. This model can identify and classify objects in images and videos with remarkable speed and accuracy, making it an ideal choice for creating labeled datasets without extensive manual effort. By using **RT-DETR** as a teacher model, the generated labels can then be used to train smaller, student models, facilitating the development of efficient and high-performing machine learning systems. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to annotate the collected data, we will need to run inferences using the **STAI_MPU API** and the **RT-DETR** model exported previously to ONNX format. Some of the model's operator are not supported by the NPU compiler, hence the unique execution provider for these inference session should be the CPU. For these reasons and due to the teacher model size, each of the inferences should take few seconds to reach high accuracy predictions. "

    "### 7. Data loader instance for the SSD MobileNetv2:\n",
    "To facilitate the training process of the student model, we need to define a data loader that efficiently handles the loading and batching of our dataset. The data loader will be responsible for reading the images and their corresponding Pascal VOC XML annotations, applying any necessary transformations and augmentations, and organizing the data into batches suitable for training. This ensures that the model receives data in a consistent and optimized manner, improving the training efficiency and performance. The data loader will also handle shuffling the dataset to ensure that the model generalizes well and does not overfit to specific data patterns.  </br> We start by defining a class that applies some transformations on the dataset before feeding it into the dataloader: converting image data to float32, normalizing bounding box coordinates to a percentage of the image dimensions, resizing the image to a specified size, subtracting a mean value from the image for normalization, dividing by a standard deviation, and transposing the image dimensions to have the channel first. This ensures the images are in the correct format and scale for training. "

    "With the labeled dataset prepared and verified, we can now proceed to train the student model. The student model will be trained using the annotations generated by the teacher model, leveraging the high-quality labels to learn and generalize object detection tasks. This training process involves feeding the pre-processed images and their corresponding labels into the student model, optimizing the model parameters through iterative learning. The goal is to achieve a model that performs efficiently and accurately in detecting objects, even with potentially fewer resources or simpler architecture compared to the teacher model. The following cell will initiate the training process, detailing the configuration, hyperparameters, and training loop necessary to build a robust student model. </br> The first step here will consist of generating the Anchor Boxes to be used with the Anchox Box matcher."
